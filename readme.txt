Stable tag: trunk

A simple widget that displays only the most recent tweet from multiple accounts.

== Description ==

Have a team or group of tweeters that you'd like to show on a site? 
The problem with most Wordpress Twitter Plugins is that the few that support multiple twitter accounts
usually show the tweets of the users in chronological order. This means if USER A tweets more than USER B
your whole feed might be all about USER A. I found in many cases that I'd rather pull in the most recent tweet
from each user. So that's what this plugin does. It will also pull in search results and hashtags


**CHANGELOG**

1.0.1	Re-arranged files get plugin working properly
1.1.0	Added chronological sorting for feeds
1.2.0	Added option on widget to limit feed
1.2.5	Added options in the widget settings to link #hashtags and @replies.
1.3.0	Added options for search terms in addition to accounts
1.3.1	Updated to support 3.0
1.3.2	Using 2.8 deprecated tags due to lack of documentation
1.3.3	Added in Option to enable/disable dates, cleaned up logic
